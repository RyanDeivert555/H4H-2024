        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>This website was created to help active people such as runners, bikers, and those walking to work to find quality 
            drinking fountains and/or waterbottle refill stations. This allows users to rely less on single-use plastic bottles. 
            This website allows you to find high-quality drinking fountains, as rated by other users, as well as contribute ratings of your own. 
            To submit a rating or view other ratings, sign in and then head to the <em><i>Ratings</i></em> tab above.
